Game Theory,40.316,"The course will provide a consistent framework for game-theoretic concepts, some of which have already been informally presented to the students in other courses. The course will cover the basic concepts in game theory, allowing the students to use strategic models in their capstone research.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,40.001,or 30.3003/50.034 instead of 40.005
Financial Systems Design,40.317,"This is a course in computational finance in which students learn the tools for delivering financial services and the algorithms used to price complex financial instruments (derivatives). It also abstracts the design of financial services, focusing on interface design, which reduces to language design. Only moderate coding proficiency is required (Python 3) but there are weekly coding exercises. The design exercise is to propose an interactive, distributed trading game and to specify the interfaces.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,40.242,
Supply Chain Digitalisation and Design,40.318,"Successful orchestration of planning and execution processes across virtual and global supply chain networks is a critical success factor for today?€?s businesses. This necessitates tight information integration across business functions and a strong alignment between the business and information technology functions. In the first half of the course we will study supply chain operations of a global manufacturing and distribution company, the NOVA Corporation. Using an experiential simulation of the company?€?s supply chain, we will identify common errors in the design of such systems. We will see in greater detail how logistics policies, organizational design, performance measurement systems, information flows, and even currency fluctuations can impact a company?€?s performance. Customer requirements ultimately determine a company?€?s manufacturing and distribution system requirements. The course material is unified around the theme of applying five basic principles of supply chain management to global manufacturing and logistics. The second half of the course develops a framework and process for discovering the value potential of digitalisation and ensuring value realization from investments in digital technologies.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,40.26,
