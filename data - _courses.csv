The World Since 1400,02.102DH,"This course surveys the social, economic, and political evolution of societies and cultures from about the year 1400 to the present. The course?€?s primary theme is the increasing interaction between communities as the barrier of distance succumbed to both curiosity and new transport technologies. It will also explore the unexpected rise to world dominance of Western Europe and the United States over the past 500 years, the ?€?great divergence?€? in material, political, and technological development that occurred between Western Europe and East Asia after 1750, and the resulting impact on the rest of the world. It attempts to present this history in an integrative fashion. It will examine processes, trends, and environmental factors at the trans-regional or global level, rather than presenting a series of histories of different regions in sequence. It seeks to accomplish this by emphasizing human encounters as well as material, cultural, and biological exchanges between different regions, cultures, and civilizations. In the process, we will examine a series of evolving relationships, those between human beings and their physical environment, between different religious and political systems, between different ethnic groups, and between men and women. The comparative study of these relationships will play a crucial role in illustrating the major patterns in history.  In addition to improving critical reading and writing skills, this course will also serve as an introduction to historical and other interpretive methodologies: in each class, students will be expected to analyze and interpret both primary and secondary source materials.",,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,

Multicultural Archipelago in History and Story,02.114DH,"This course provides a general view of multicultural experiences in the SE Asian archipelago (including peninsular Malaysia) through historical and literary lenses.  Starting with a concept of multiculturalism developed for this region in particular, the course introduces the long-term historical tendency of Malayo-Indonesian civilization to absorb foreign ideas and persons, and goes on to considers both (1) how the pluralistic culture of the region was affected in the modern period by increasing immigration (by both indigenous groups moving within  the archipelago and non-indigenous groups  moving into the archipelago), as well as by European colonization and the introduction of modernization; and (2) how the lives of colonial subjects protested against both native norms and colonial governance. Important literary works by Javanese, Malay, English, Dutch, and Chinese authors dating from the 19th and 20th centuries are informed by recent histories of these same groups by contemporary scholars of the SE Asian archipelago.

Global Shakespeares,02.115DH,"If Shakespeare could travel through time to the twenty-first century, he would be bewildered to discover that his works were being read and studied as academic texts in university classrooms. In this course, we will read several of Shakespeare?€?s works?€?including The Merchant of Venice, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear, and The Tempest?€?without staying tethered to words on a printed page. In Shakespeare?€?s London, playwriting was neither scholarly nor static. His was a dynamic, collaborative, open-access world in which writers borrowed freely from old material and re-shaped it into new forms of entertainment?€?a concept of creativity that connects Shakespeare to many of his interpreters and fans today. The public theater was one of the most successful forums for popular culture in Renaissance England, and Shakespeare wrote his plays for large and diverse audiences. During Shakespeare?€?s time, it would not have been unusual for the queen or king of England to be in attendance, watching the performance alongside the groundlings?€?the often rowdy theatergoers from London?€?s working classes. In this seminar, we will respond to cinematic productions that restore Shakespeare?€?s characters and themes to popular culture?€?both in his own time and around the world. In this course, we?€?ll read and analyze Shakespeare?€?s original playtexts alongside global cinematic productions of his plays, including a Bollywood-inspired retelling of Othello and a feudal Japanese reimagining of King Lear.

The Word and the World: Introducing Literary Theory,02.116DH,"This course critically appraises the way we read. In our highly literate world, reading is a daily practice for most people ?€? whether it is engaging a newspaper, a book, a report or postings on the social media. However, reading is not a passive process. People read a text according to certain assumptions and biases that they have. For the most part, readers are unaware of such preconceived ideas. Yet, they go on to make decisions based on these. An awareness of the process of reading makes us more conscious of our assumptions and biases, leading us to make informed judgments or decisions on a daily basis. In other words, it can help us understand how a text was designed and how to better interpret it. Designed for students with no prior knowledge of literary theory, this module aims to provide students with a basic understanding of how they can approach and interpret texts as a means of analysing them. To this end, students will be introduced to some important strategies for engaging with literary texts developed in the twentieth century and beyond, paying special attention to poststructuralist theories, their precursors and legacy. In order to concretely understand how literary theory work, students will read literary texts and films alongside the theoretical material each week. They will be guided on how to apply a specific reading strategy to explore a text or film. The sense of self-reflexivity of how we read is a transferable skill that students can use when interpreting not just literary texts but also events and problems.",,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,

A Commentary on Heidegger?€?s Being and Time and a few other supplementary texts. The influence of the ideas exposed in B&T is not limited to the specialists of philosophy, but has spread to different fields of human knowledge, from Physics to Biology, from Architecture to the Arts, from Psychology to Medicine. Written in the late 1920s, M. Heidegger developed a way to understand the human being and through this understanding, a profound grasp of the essence of our present time,what he calls the accomplishment of the age of Techne, represented by the continuous development of technology.

The Question of Technology,02.135DH,"The era of technology in which we live has widened the gap between Man and Nature. This divergence is particularly evident in the dichotomy man-made vs. nature-made. At the core of this dichotomy we find ?€?making?€?, something whose meaning we take for granted, but which in truth remains enigmatic. What is making? What happens when the human being does something? How is the human being able to make anything? What is the relation between making, the human being and the world? These questions have occupied the entirety of the Western philosophical tradition since its inception until today. They are particularly relevant today, when the development of ever more sophisticated and complex machines is making so that human activity be unneeded or irrelevant in many domains. In this course we will tackle these questions by concentrating on the reflections of Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Vico and Heidegger. We will read Plato?€?s Timaeus, where the concept of making is approached through the question of how things emerge in the activity of the demiurge; we will then move to Aristotle?€?s Physics B, where the making of Nature is interrogated. Plotinus?€? Ennead III 8, in which the essence of making is seen in the activity of theory, will conclude the part on ancient philosophy. With Vico and his reflection on the relation between verum and factum (?€?true?€? and ?€?production?€?) we will enter the problematic of making as it is treated in modern philosophy. Finally, with Heidegger?€?s Letter on Humanism we will be given a perspective, which, by reading under a new light the previous tradition, opens up new horizons. This course aims at introducing students to both the history of philosophy and the active practice of philosophy itself.",,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,

"Rice Cultures: Technology, Society, and Environment in Asia",02.219TS,"This course introduces students to the social scientific study of human-environment interactions through the history and culture of a single agricultural crop: rice. The cultivation of rice dates back almost 10,000 years in Asia, and forms the core of an independent origin of civilization, distinct from other Eurasian sites that were all based around wheat/barley and millet. Some scholars hypothesize that the cultivation of rice also supports a distinctive Asian form of society, and mode of historical or technological development, that differs from standard frameworks of ?€?Western?€? modernization. Today rice is one of the most intensively researched crops, as both a model organism for advanced research in genomics and an important object of genetic modification experiments. We will explore how the cultivation of rice raises exciting and provocative questions about the relationships among society, technology and environment. The course asks whether Asia?€?s history and culture of rice can provide an alternative figure of technological development and design, and perhaps a model for a sustainable relationship between humans and their natural environments.",,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,
"How the Things People Make, Make People: Material Things in Social Life",02.220TS,"There is no denying that humans live in a material world. Whether they are naturally existing objects (such as rocks or trees) or the products of human intentional design and labor (tools, new technologies, buildings), our everyday lives are deeply and intimately entangled with material things. While we are inclined to think of these as merely the mute backdrop of human behavior, or as the products or utilitarian instruments of our purposive actions, greater reflection shows us that these material objects also act consequentially on us, and even transform us in their own image. In recent years, diverse academic disciplines across the humanities and social sciences (such as anthropology, archeology, philosophy, literary criticism, and art history and theory, among others) have begun to reverse this taken for granted view by inquiring into how, in the words of anthropologist Daniel Miller, ?€?the things that people make, make people.?€? What exactly is the nature of our social relationship with the material world and our own products?  How, for example, do things play active roles in the production and maintenance of human identities and relationships, from the structure and composition of families, to ideas about differences in class, race, ethnicity and gender? How do they come to stand as emblems of much broader political and economic orders such as nation-states and global economic structures? How do objects come to embody history or the passage of time? Antiquities, ?€?heritage objects?€? and museum artifacts are seen as representing persisting values (and evaluation) of the past, while the constant cycle of production, circulation, consumption, and obscelescence of new technologies and consumer objects gives physical form to people?€?s experiences of capitalist modernity. How do wearable technologies both old (pocket and wristwatches) and new (wireless wearable technologies) structure people?€?s experiences of time, or ideas about healthy and unhealthy human bodies or activities? How do the technologies we design to improve the conditions of human life, take on lives of their own, from the atomic bomb to computer code? This course begins to address these (and other) questions by exploring classic, foundational, and recent scholarly works within the field of ?€?material culture studies.?€? While varied in their specific orientations, the general thrust of these approaches to material things has been to empirically demonstrate how they act in and on the worlds of which they are a part. As such, objects can be subjects endowed with a particular (and rather peculiar) form of agency. To explore how this is the case, we will examine a range of scholars and practitioners whose work troubles the boundaries between given philosophical and empirical categories such as subjects and objects, production, circulation, and consumption, gifts and commodities, creative works of art, technological artifacts, and found aesthetic objects. After close in-class engagement with these orienting works, the course will culminate with students?€? production of an ?€?object ethnography?€? project, which analyzes a particular material object/thing as a window into its broader social importance, context of production, circulation, and consumption, social connectivities, and agentive influence and impact on its surrounding world.",,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,
Unnatural Disasters,02.222TS,"When tsunamis flood cities, earthquakes turn highways to rubble, and epidemics of killer disease break out, we often blame Nature for bringing disaster onto vulnerable human populations.  To prevent future catastrophe, we place our faith in science and technology, hoping to better control Nature?€?s forces next time.  Yet the fault lines of disaster often fall along lines laid out by human activities and plans, including earlier projects of science and engineering.  Flooding in one part of New Orleans resulted from the construction of dykes in other parts, for instance; and the 3-11 tsunami?€?s most terrible outcome was due to the design and location of the Fukushima nuclear plant. In this course, we explore these human, social and cultural dimensions of natural and technological disasters.  The course begins by exploring how the idea of a ?€?natural?€? disaster, devoid of divine intervention or religious meaning, first emerged.  Through a series of cases from around the world, the course then explores why contemporary disasters can be considered ?€?unnatural:?€? how do disasters expose and exacerbate the contours of social inequality?  How has human technological intervention increased vulnerability to disaster?  How are science, technology, economy and politics implicated in disaster response?  And how can the variations of culture, belief and cosmology be included in our understanding of disasters? In their assignments, students will conduct ?€?social autopsies?€? of disasters, and will appraise how technological design and engineering can both mitigate and enhance the risk and vulnerability to disaster.",,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,
